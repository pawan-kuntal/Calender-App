🗓️ Modern Calendar App

A fully responsive Calendar Application built with React (TypeScript) and Vite, designed to manage daily schedules efficiently.
This project demonstrates my ability to design scalable frontend architecture, implement interactive components, and deliver a clean, high-performance UI using shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS.



🎯 Project Overview

The Calendar App allows users to:

📅 View calendars in monthly and weekly formats

📝 Add, edit, and delete events in an intuitive interface

🧭 Navigate between dates smoothly

📱 Access the app seamlessly on both desktop and mobile

It focuses on performance, reusability, and modern design principles — essential traits for production-grade web applications.
